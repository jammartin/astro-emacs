* Vanilla Emacs Workflow

** Basic Keybindings

Emacs offers a well though of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf][set of keybindings]] out of the box, which is usually referred to as "Vanilla Emacs".
Although I am using Emacs as editor for everything, I only know the following keybindings by heart,
which are sufficient to get me through most of my everyday tasks.
For everyone who is completely new to Emacs:
- ~C~ denotes the control key (~ctrl~ by default)
- ~M~ denotes the meta key (~alt~ by default)
- Files (and other data) are opened in buffers
- Windows are used to display buffers
- Frames host one or more windows (which is referred to as "windows" commonly for other programs)
Finally, pay attention to the minibuffer (command line in the bottom left of your Emacs frame)
to keep track what you're doing.
